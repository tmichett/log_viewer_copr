# This is a placeholder for the LogViewer icon
# In a real build, this should be a proper PNG icon file (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
# You can create an icon using any image editor and save it as smallicon.png
# 
# For now, this text file serves as a placeholder to prevent build errors
# The application will still function without the icon, though it may not
# display properly in desktop environments
